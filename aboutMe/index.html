    <h2>Aiden Kelley</h2>
    <p>My name is Aiden Kelley, and I am majoring in computer science/programming. I love to play video games and airsoft and I like to make VR games.
        Before I came here I worked on a blueberry farm in Oregon, and I lived in Silverton Oregon, a small town in western Oregon. Now I just do school
        and work on my games in my free time. I'm excited to learn about web design, I've never done any web design and it seems like one of those things 
        that every programmer has to have done at least some of.
